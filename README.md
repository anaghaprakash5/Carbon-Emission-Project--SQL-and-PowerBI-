# Carbon Emission Project Using SQL and PowerBI

In this project, I an using SQL and Power BI to analyze and visualize carbon emissions data, identifying the highest and lowest annual emissions and comparing changes in emissions per capita between 1975 and 2017.

1. Project Overview

    * SQL Features: SQL functions and commands using:
        * Data selection and filtering: SELECT, SELECT TOP, FROM, WHERE
        * Sorting and grouping: ORDER BY, GROUP BY
        * Aggregations: MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), ROUND()
        * Table creation and joins: CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, WITH AS, INNER JOIN

    * Power BI Features: Key Power BI tools include:
        * Area chart, donut chart, multi-row card, clustered column chart
        * Smart Narrative for dynamic text and slicers for filtering

2. Dataset Details
